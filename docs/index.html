<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>While in my final years at university I thought it was interesting to learn about continuous integration and build
    tools. Since I was doing assignments in programming languages that have these documentation tools, I set up
    the documentation to be automatically build every time I pushed to the respective repository. In some ways this is a
    bit of a graveyard for old code, but it remains as an interesting reminder to myself that I did this.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="k-means">k-means</a> - An efficient k-means implementation in clojure.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="CSC241">CSC241</a> - A Java subject I took while on exchange.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="health-search">Health Search</a> - A search engine assignment with a clojure client for Elasticsearch.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="INB334">INB334</a> - Docs for a search engine subject at university.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, I tend to write a lot of code in Python and Go. I found that Python does not really have automated
    documentation tools (and if it did I could never find it) - I found it silly to have to rewrite things into .rst
    files. Go on the other hand has nicer tools and a service that hosts documentation for free; so that's what I use
    now.</p>
