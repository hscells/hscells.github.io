&lt;p>A recent study showed that students in IR courses are especially motivated and learn more effectively when they participate in shared tasks as part of their coursework. To support teachers in integrating such activities, we present Web IDE-based applications and tutorials that employ TIREx and ir_datasets to cover the process of a typical shared task in IR: from creating test collections over developing retrieval systems to making relevance judgments and finally statistically analyzing the results. Using our tools, students can gain hands-on experience with empirical IR research by working on some current shared task, by working on earlier collections, or by creating new ones. Our experiences in implementing the cor- responding teaching concept in four IR courses at two universities confirm that students are very motivated to conduct research, and we also find that some of the resulting artifacts (e.g., studentsâ€™ test collections and retrieval approaches) are of really good quality.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
