    <h1>QueryLab</h1>
    <p>QueryLab is a framework for constructing and executing information retrieval experiment pipelines. The framework
        as a whole is built primarily for domain specific applications such as medical literature search for systematic
        reviews, or finding factually or legally applicable case law in the legal domain; however it can also be used
        for more general tasks. There are a number of pre-implemented components that enable common information
        retrieval experiments such as ad-hoc retrieval or query analysis through query performance predictors. In
        addition, this collection of tools seeks to be user friendly, well documented, and easily extendible. Finally,
        the entire pipeline can be distributed as a single binary with no dependencies, ready to use with a simple
        domain specific language (DSL) for constructing pipelines.</p>

    <h3>Common Query Representation</h3>
    <p>﻿The common query representation module is used to simplify experiments in the rest of the pipeline. It forms the
        basis for how queries are represented and specifies how they can be transformed. The representation is similar
        to that of the Elasticsearch DSL. There are two possible representations of a query: the first is a keyword
        which is similar to what is seen in web search --- a string of characters restricted to some fields; the second
        is a Boolean query --- which combines keyword queries with logical operators. A CQR query in human-readable
        notation takes the form of JSON.</p>
    <h3>Transmute</h3>
    <p>﻿When replicating a domain-specific IR task, it is often required to use a specific query
        language. These queries can either be manually translated by
        hand or automatically by a parser/compiler into a target query language for use in an IR system. The
        transmute library and command-line tool is a parser/compiler for queries from one query language to
        another. Currently, transmute can transform Medline and PubMed queries, and CQR queries into
        Elasticsearch queries (the Terrier query language is currently being implemented).</p>
    <h3>Groove</h3>
    <p>﻿The groove library provides abstractions and implementations for performing IR experiments. A
        groove pipeline comprises a query source (the format of the queries), a statistic source (a source for
        computing IR statistics; i.e. a search engine such as Elasticsearch or Terrier), preprocessing steps (e.g.,
        lowercase, stemming, stopword removal), any measurements to make (e.g., query performance predictors, retrieval
        results, evaluation criteria), and any output formats (e.g., JSON, csv). Each component in the
        pipeline is extendible and well documented.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, groove can load Medline and PubMed queries (query languages commonly used in systematic
        reviews) via transmute, and LexesNexes queries (a query language commonly used in legal IR) via an
        implementation integrated into groove.
    </p>
    <h3>Boogie</h3>
    <p>﻿The boogie command-line utility provides higher level access to groove. It allows for the
        specification of a pipeline to be written in a domain specific language (DSL) that groove can then
        execute. At a high level, the purpose of this pipeline is to compute measurements for MEDLINE queries between a
        number of query performance predictors and the performance of the actual effectiveness of the queries in terms
        of precision and recall.
    </p>
    <p>At a deeper level, reading the pipeline from top to bottom: the type of queries are specified
        (MEDLINE), the source of statistical information (i.e. search engine) is configured to point to an
        Elasticsearch instance, the list of query performance predictors measurements are listed followed by the
        evaluation measures to record, and, finally, the last item specifies how the results of the pipeline should be
        output and in which formats (the trec_eval-style results file is also output so as to record the
        retrieval results.</p>
