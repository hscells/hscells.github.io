With the many choices about how to construct a query, it is difficult to both formulate and recognise effective queries. To address this challenge, automatic methods have recently been explored for generating and selecting effective Boolean query variations for systematic reviews. The limiting factor of these methods is that it is computationally infeasible to process all query variations for training the methods. To overcome this, we propose novel query variation sampling methods for training Learning to Rank models to rank queries. Our results show that query sampling methods do directly impact the ability of a Learning to Rank model to effectively identify good query variations. Thus, selecting appropriate query sampling methods is a key problem for the automatic reformulation of effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search.

With the many choices about how to construct a query, it is difficult to both formulate and recognise effective queries.","tags":null,"title":"Sampling Query Variations for Learning to Rank to Improve Automatic Boolean Query Generation in Systematic Reviews","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

In the medical domain, systematic reviews are one type of digital document that is often updated after initial publication. This is usually because new evidence has been discovered and must be re-synthesised into the existing review. A problem, however, is that the initial search strategy used to identify the originally relevant studies may not be sufficient in capturing new studies, or may capture too many irrelevant studies. This means that time and effort must be spent reformulating new or variant search strategies. While this problem may be particularly pronounced in “living systematic reviews”, the problem of finding all relevant studies while minimising irrelevant studies for typical systematic reviews is also difficult. This overarching problem signifies a gap to be filled with a system for automatic search strategy reformulation.\nObjectives: The development of an automatic, interactive search strategy reformulation tool that assists researchers in updating systematic reviews and to improve existing search strategies.\nMethods: The system proposed uses a recognised and effective theoretical framework which automatically generates search strategy reformulations and selects the most effective variation. In this work, a user interface (Figure 1) is developed with the goal to insert a human-in-the-loop to drive the selection of the most effective search strategy. This interface is capable of: (i) tracking the effectiveness of reformulations over time, allowing users to manage their reformulation history by backtracking and jumping to previous search strategies, (ii) evaluating the effectiveness of reformulations using standard Information Retrieval measures (e.g., precision, recall, F-measure), and domain-specific evaluation measures (e.g., Work Saved) by loading in a validation set of studies, and (iii) filtering out studies which have already been screened (also by loading separately) in order to only show new studies.\nResults: The theoretical framework for which the generation and selection of search strategy reformulations is based on is shown to significantly improve the effectiveness of existing queries. Queries are shown to increase in effectiveness upwards of 100-200% and beyond depending on the automatic selection process and evaluation measure.\nConclusions: A human-in-the-loop for the selection of search strategy reformulation allows users to have fine-grained control over the reformulation process. Allowing humans to drive the selection process in this framework is a new and novel approach, which has not yet been attempted. Finally, automatically generating reformulations removes possible human bias and error, and reduces the time and effort required to update a review.\nPatient or healthcare consumer involvement: This has no direct involvement with patients or consumers, although improved efficiency of systematic review searches could be beneficial to both groups.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"293ce5795647970ec9c3690a561067ae","permalink":"/publication/cc2019_reformulation/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cc2019_reformulation/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Within the last decade the rise of digital publishing has become widespread, enabling publications to be edited and updated after-the-fact.

Systematic reviews must be complete in that all relevant literature for the research question of the review must be synthesised in order to produce a recommendation. To identify the literature to screen for inclusion in systematic reviews, information specialists construct complex Boolean queries that capture the information needs defined by the research questions of the systemic review. However, in the quest for total recall, these Boolean queries return many non relevant results.\nIn this paper, we propose automatic methods for Boolean query refinement in the context of systematic review literature retrieval with the aim of alleviating this high recall-low precision problem. To do this, we build upon current literature and define additional semantic transformations for Boolean queries in the form of query expansion and reduction. Empirical evaluation is done on a set of real systematic review queries to show how our method performs in a realistic setting. We found that query refinement strategies produced queries that were more effective than the original in terms of six information retrieval evaluation measures. In particular, queries were refined to increase precision, while maintaining, or even increasing, recall — this, in turn, translates into both time and cost savings when creating laborious and expensive systematic reviews.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b5ab0247a1dc7bca6c186ce6fb0d0908","permalink":"/publication/www2019_boolean/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/www2019_boolean/","section":"publication","summary":"In the medical domain, systematic reviews are a highly trustworthy evidence source used to inform clinical diagnosis and treatment, and governmental policy making.

The effectiveness of these search strategies directly impacts the workload associated with conducting a systematic review. More efficient search strategies can reduce the time and resources required to screen studies therefore reducing the total time and cost of the review. Research in Information Retrieval (IR) shows that query visualisation improves the effectiveness of searching for information.\nObjectives: The development of a visualisation tool that assists information specialists in formulating more effective search strategies.\nMethods: The visualisation tool (QueryVis) is designed in collaboration with information specialists to cater to the needs of this user group. Currently in QueryVis, it is possible to visualise search strategies using the PubMed database. Searches can be submitted in Ovid MEDLINE format or PubMed format (by automatically translating the Ovid format to PubMed). QueryVis presents queries hierarchically (Figure 1) , showing the impact that each term has on the recall and precision of a search. Recall is shown by the number of studies retrieved from a validation set, loaded via PubMed IDs. Precision is shown by total number of studies found by each term. Search strategies are compared in terms of the overlap in search terms between two searches, the total number of keywords, the total number of each Boolean operator (i.e., AND, OR, NOT), the number of MeSH keywords (and how many are exploded), and the depth in the MeSH ontology in which the MeSH keywords appear (i.e., how broad MeSH keywords are). Furthermore, each search is evaluated in terms of effectiveness: using standard IR evaluation measures (i.e., precision, recall, F-measure) and evaluation measures specific to this domain (e.g., Work Saved), and in terms of efficiency: by recording the total time spent formulating, the number of studies retrieved, and the estimated cost of the search.\nResults: QueryVis has been tested experimentally in a pilot study. It decreased irrelevant studies by as much as 40% without losing relevant studies. A wider study is planned which aims to involve more participants and capture more data.\nConclusions: Improving the query formulation stage can have a significant impact on the rest of the systematic review creation process. An extensive user study will follow using a well-known corpus of systematic reviews with approximately 10 participants to determine precisely what effect visualisation has on the search strategy formulation process. The study will use the aforementioned methods to compare the effect visualisation has on search by comparing search strategies formulated with and without visualisation. If accepted for publication, QueryVis will be demoed during the oral presentation.\nPatient or healthcare consumer involvement: This has no direct involvement with patients or consumers, although improved efficiency of systematic review searches could be beneficial to both groups.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"200a87fa116bd3cde5243b5c6f4834d8","permalink":"/publication/cc2019_visualisation/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cc2019_visualisation/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Searching for studies to include in systematic reviews involves the construction of complex search strategies.
