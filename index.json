Prioritising the most important documents ensures that subsequent review steps can be carried out more efficiently and effectively. The current state of the art uses the final title of the review as a query to rank the documents using BERT-based neural rankers. However, the final title is only formulated at the end of the review process, which makes this approach impractical as it relies on ex post facto information. At the time of screening, only a rough working title is available, with which the BERT-based ranker performs significantly worse than with the final title. In this paper, we explore alternative sources of queries for prioritising screening, such as the Boolean query used to retrieve the documents to be screened and queries generated by instruction-based generative large-scale language models such as ChatGPT and Alpaca.

Consequently, researchers have started exploring the development of a green agenda for sustainable information retrieval research and operation. Previous work, however, has primarily considered energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions alone. In this paper, we seek to draw the information retrieval community’s attention to the overlooked aspect of water consumption related to these powerful models. We supplement previous energy consumption estimates with corresponding water consumption estimates, considering both off-site water consumption (required for operating and cooling energy production systems such as carbon and nuclear power plants) and on-site consumption (for cooling the data centres where models are trained and operated). By incorporating water consumption alongside energy consumption and CO2 emissions, we offer a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact of information retrieval research and operation.\n","date":1691539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691539200,"objectID":"9676393a921f42b64b79264cdf0a6852","permalink":"/publication/ictir2023_c02/","publishdate":"2023-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ictir2023_c02/","section":"publication","summary":"As in other fields of artificial intelligence, the information retrieval community has grown interested in investigating the power consumption associated with neural models, particularly models of search.

Screening prioritisation is the process of ranking the (unordered) set of retrieved documents, allowing assessors to begin the downstream processes of the systematic review creation earlier, leading to earlier completion of the review, or even avoiding screening documents ranked least relevant.\nScreening prioritisation requires highly effective ranking methods. Pre-trained language models are state-of-the-art on many IR tasks but have yet to be applied to systematic review screening prioritisation. In this paper, we apply several pre-trained language models to the systematic review document ranking task, both directly and fine-tuned. An empirical analysis compares how effective neural methods compare to traditional methods for this task. We also investigate different types of document representations for neural methods and their impact on ranking performance.\nOur results show that BERT-based rankers outperform the current state-of-the-art screening prioritisation methods.

Overall, our research finds that ChatGPT has the potential to generate effective Boolean queries. The ability of ChatGPT to follow complex instructions and generate highly precise queries makes it a tool of potential value for researchers conducting systematic reviews, particularly for rapid reviews where time is a constraint and where one can trade off higher precision for lower recall.

Boolean queries, developed by expert librarians, are the standard for systematic reviews. They guarantee reproducible and verifiable retrieval and more control than free-text queries. However, the result sets of Boolean queries are unranked and difficult to control due to the strict Boolean operators. We address these problems in a single unified retrieval model by formulating a class of smooth operators that are compatible with and extend existing Boolean operators. Our smooth operators overcome several shortcomings of previous extensions of the Boolean retrieval model. In particular, our operators are independent of the underlying ranking function, so that exact-match and large language model rankers can be combined in the same query. We found that replacing Boolean operators with equivalent or similar smooth operators often improves the effectiveness of queries. Their properties make tuning a query to precision or recall intuitive and allow greater control over how documents are retrieved.

How do governments and institutions make health policy decisions?\nAt heart, the answer to both of these questions is consulting a specific, focused, and comprehensive systematic review of medical literature. In the medical domain, systematic reviews are central to decision-making for both clinical practice (e.g., “Does hydrocloroquin treat COVID-19?”), as well as institutional and governmental medical policy-making (e.g., “Should everyone wear a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic?”). Once a review is published. However, new studies and evidence can arise or be retracted, which may change the review’s conclusions. In areas of medicine where there is a priority for decision-making, a level of uncertainty in existing studies, and the frequency of new medical studies is high (e.g., identifying the most effective treatment for COVID-19), systematic reviews are infeasible.\nThis infeasibility is primarily due to the lengthy and costly processes involved in creating these systematic reviews. The most expensive and time-intensive aspect is the manual, critical appraisal of studies, which can take several years and cost upwards of 220,000 Euros to complete. Already, several researchers have highlighted that systematic reviews are not sufficient for the pace at which studies are currently being published. Several studies have spawned to address this problem, such as machine learning methods, summarisation of studies, guidelines for building automation tools, and even proposing a new type of “living” systematic review. However, I will be taking a radically different approach to answer the initial questions posed above in this project. I plan to focus on synthesising direct answers for highly focused, complex medical questions using NLP methods.\nTo this end, I will investigate, apply, and derive new state-of-the-art methods for direct answer synthesis within the medical domain.\n","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"dfebdfecff5a7a0275067e80640b8aaf","permalink":"/project/alive/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/alive/","section":"project","summary":"How do clinicians become informed to treat their patients?

Complexity comes from the reliance on lengthy Boolean queries, which express a detailed research question. To aid query formulation, information specialists use a set of exemplar documents, called ‘seed studies’, prior to query formulation. Seed studies help verify the effectiveness of a query prior to the full assessment of retrieved studies. Beyond this use of seeds, specific IR methods can exploit seed studies for guiding both automatic query formulation and new retrieval models. One major limitation of work to date is that these methods exploit `pseudo seed studies’ through retrospective use of included studies (i.e., relevance assessments). However, we show pseudo seed studies are not representative of real seed studies used by information specialists. Hence, we provide a test collection with real world seed studies used to assist with the formulation of queries. To support our collection, we provide an analysis, previously not possible, on how seed studies impact retrieval and perform several experiments using seed-study based methods to compare the effectiveness of using seed studies versus pseudo seed studies. We make our test collection and the results of all of our experiments and analysis available at http://github.com/ielab/sysrev-seed-collection. High-quality medical systematic reviews require comprehensive literature searches to ensure the recommendations and outcomes are sufficiently reliable. Indeed, searching for relevant medical literature is a key phase in constructing systematic reviews and often involves domain (medical researchers) and search (information specialists) experts in developing the search queries. Queries in this context are highly complex, based on Boolean logic, include free-text terms and index terms from standardised terminologies (e.g., the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus), and are difficult and time-consuming to build. The use of MeSH terms, in particular, has been shown to improve the quality of the search results. However, identifying the correct MeSH terms to include in a query is difficult: information experts are often unfamiliar with the MeSH database and unsure about the appropriateness of MeSH terms for a query. Naturally, the full value of the MeSH terminology is often not fully exploited. This article investigates methods to suggest MeSH terms based on an initial Boolean query that includes only free-text terms. In this context, we devise lexical and pre-trained language models based methods. These methods promise to automatically identify highly effective MeSH terms for inclusion in a systematic review query. Our study contributes an empirical evaluation of several MeSH term suggestion methods. We further contribute an extensive analysis of MeSH term suggestions for each method and how these suggestions impact the effectiveness of Boolean queries.\n","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"d4bfe714c90afb64abbca5bef8eb4857","permalink":"/publication/iswa2022_automated/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iswa2022_automated/","section":"publication","summary":"Medical systematic review query formulation is a highly complex task done by trained information specialists.

Typically, a Boolean query retrieves the set of studies to screen. As the set of studies retrieved is unordered, screening all retrieved studies is usually required for high-quality systematic reviews. Screening prioritisation, or in other words, ranking the set of studies, enables downstream activities of a systematic review to begin in parallel. We investigate a method that exploits seed studies – potentially relevant studies used to seed the query formulation process – for screening prioritisation. Our investigation aims to reproduce this method to determine if it is generalisable on recently published datasets and determine the impact of using multiple seed studies on effectiveness. We show that while we could reproduce the original methods, we could not replicate their results exactly. However, we believe this is due to minor differences in document pre-processing, not deficiencies with the original methodology. Our results also indicate that our reproduced screening prioritisation method, (1) is generalisable across datasets of similar and different topicality compared to the original implementation, (2) that when using multiple seed studies, the effectiveness of the method increases using our techniques to enable this, (3) and that the use of multiple seed studies produces more stable rankings compared to single seed studies.

A systematic review is a synthesis of very high-quality medical studies with a stringent protocol to guide creation with minimal bias and error. Modern medicine practice and healthcare policies rely heavily on systematic reviews in order to make decisions on the best available evidence.\nSystematic review creation is often highly time-intensive and costly. Thus there has been much attention to attempt to automate phases in the creation of a systematic review. In this context, the definition of automation is the encoding of manual tasks into computational procedures. Existing automation research has primarily focused on the phase concerned with the critical appraisal of studies. Prior research has attempted to automate this appraisal phase by, for example, simulating human appraisal, (re-)ranking the retrieved studies, and classifying relevant studies, among others. A major drawback of these approaches is that they all rely on the initial search’s retrieval effectiveness, which is contingent on the query’s quality. We follow a fresh, new direction of research by investigating methods for query automation.\nIn investigating automatic methods for building effective queries for systematic review creation, this thesis develops three main areas of enquiry: (i) query formulation: the development of Boolean queries suitable for systematic review literature search, (ii) query refinement: the iterative process of improving the search effectiveness of a Boolean query suitable for systematic review literature search, and (iii) query exploitation: the application of methods to Boolean queries in order to improve systematic review literature search effectiveness. For each of these query automation areas, this thesis devises computational methods as well as practical tools.\nThis thesis makes contributions across three main areas of enquiry. They comprise of: (i) computational adaptations of human query formulation methodologies to support the automatic development of complex Boolean queries for systematic review literature search, and practical tools built upon them, (ii) a framework for the generation and identification of more effective query variations to support the automatic refinement of high-quality Boolean queries used in systematic review literature search, as well as tools built upon them, and (iii) methods to exploit intrinsic characteristics of Boolean queries in order to improve the retrieval effectiveness of systematic review literature search. We found that for each of these inquiry areas, query automation was able to improve search effectiveness, reducing the amount of time necessary to create systematic reviews.\n","date":1626739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626739200,"objectID":"e2bbfd669abcce0d8695bdc7bb581705","permalink":"/publication/phd_thesis/","publishdate":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phd_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"This thesis explores and investigates query automation methods and tools to support more effective study retrieval for the creation of medical systematic reviews.

Commonly, queries are formulated by information specialists using the protocol specified in the review and interactions with the research team. Information specialists have in-depth experience on how to formulate queries in this domain, but may not have in-depth knowledge about the reviews’ topics. Query formulation requires a significant amount of time and effort, and is performed interactively; specialists repeatedly formulate queries, attempt to validate their results, and reformulate specific Boolean clauses. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of automatically formulating a Boolean query from the systematic review protocol. We propose a novel five-step approach to automatic query formulation, specific to Boolean queries in this domain, which approximates the process by which information specialists formulate queries. In this process, we use syntax parsing to derive the logical structure of high-level concepts in a query, automatically extract and map concepts to entities in order to perform entity expansion, and finally apply post-processing operations (such as stemming and search filters).\nAutomatic query formulation for systematic review literature search has several benefits: (i) it can provide reviewers with an indication of the types of studies that will be retrieved, without the involvement of an information specialist, (ii) it can provide information specialists with an initial query to begin the formulation process, (iii) it can provide researchers that perform rapid reviews with a method to quickly perform searches.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"0e97de998529bbe34eff2812b8637755","permalink":"/publication/www2020_conceptual/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/www2020_conceptual/","section":"publication","summary":"Formulating Boolean queries for systematic review literature search is a challenging task.

With the many choices about how to construct a query, it is difficult to both formulate and recognise effective queries. To address this challenge, automatic methods have recently been explored for generating and selecting effective Boolean query variations for systematic reviews. The limiting factor of these methods is that it is computationally infeasible to process all query variations for training the methods. To overcome this, we propose novel query variation sampling methods for training Learning to Rank models to rank queries. Our results show that query sampling methods do directly impact the ability of a Learning to Rank model to effectively identify good query variations. Thus, selecting appropriate query sampling methods is a key problem for the automatic reformulation of effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search.

In the medical domain, systematic reviews are one type of digital document that is often updated after initial publication. This is usually because new evidence has been discovered and must be re-synthesised into the existing review. A problem, however, is that the initial search strategy used to identify the originally relevant studies may not be sufficient in capturing new studies, or may capture too many irrelevant studies. This means that time and effort must be spent reformulating new or variant search strategies. While this problem may be particularly pronounced in “living systematic reviews”, the problem of finding all relevant studies while minimising irrelevant studies for typical systematic reviews is also difficult. This overarching problem signifies a gap to be filled with a system for automatic search strategy reformulation.\nObjectives: The development of an automatic, interactive search strategy reformulation tool that assists researchers in updating systematic reviews and to improve existing search strategies.\nMethods: The system proposed uses a recognised and effective theoretical framework which automatically generates search strategy reformulations and selects the most effective variation. In this work, a user interface (Figure 1) is developed with the goal to insert a human-in-the-loop to drive the selection of the most effective search strategy. This interface is capable of: (i) tracking the effectiveness of reformulations over time, allowing users to manage their reformulation history by backtracking and jumping to previous search strategies, (ii) evaluating the effectiveness of reformulations using standard Information Retrieval measures (e.g., precision, recall, F-measure), and domain-specific evaluation measures (e.g., Work Saved) by loading in a validation set of studies, and (iii) filtering out studies which have already been screened (also by loading separately) in order to only show new studies.\nResults: The theoretical framework for which the generation and selection of search strategy reformulations is based on is shown to significantly improve the effectiveness of existing queries. Queries are shown to increase in effectiveness upwards of 100-200% and beyond depending on the automatic selection process and evaluation measure.\nConclusions: A human-in-the-loop for the selection of search strategy reformulation allows users to have fine-grained control over the reformulation process. Allowing humans to drive the selection process in this framework is a new and novel approach, which has not yet been attempted. Finally, automatically generating reformulations removes possible human bias and error, and reduces the time and effort required to update a review.\nPatient or healthcare consumer involvement: This has no direct involvement with patients or consumers, although improved efficiency of systematic review searches could be beneficial to both groups.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"293ce5795647970ec9c3690a561067ae","permalink":"/publication/cc2019_reformulation/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cc2019_reformulation/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Within the last decade the rise of digital publishing has become widespread, enabling publications to be edited and updated after-the-fact.

To identify the literature to screen for inclusion in systematic reviews, information specialists construct complex Boolean queries that capture the information needs defined by the research questions of the systemic review. However, in the quest for total recall, these Boolean queries return many non relevant results.\nIn this paper, we propose automatic methods for Boolean query refinement in the context of systematic review literature retrieval with the aim of alleviating this high recall-low precision problem. To do this, we build upon current literature and define additional semantic transformations for Boolean queries in the form of query expansion and reduction. Empirical evaluation is done on a set of real systematic review queries to show how our method performs in a realistic setting. We found that query refinement strategies produced queries that were more effective than the original in terms of six information retrieval evaluation measures.

The effectiveness of these search strategies directly impacts the workload associated with conducting a systematic review. More efficient search strategies can reduce the time and resources required to screen studies therefore reducing the total time and cost of the review. Research in Information Retrieval (IR) shows that query visualisation improves the effectiveness of searching for information.\nObjectives: The development of a visualisation tool that assists information specialists in formulating more effective search strategies.\nMethods: The visualisation tool (QueryVis) is designed in collaboration with information specialists to cater to the needs of this user group. Currently in QueryVis, it is possible to visualise search strategies using the PubMed database. Searches can be submitted in Ovid MEDLINE format or PubMed format (by automatically translating the Ovid format to PubMed). QueryVis presents queries hierarchically (Figure 1) , showing the impact that each term has on the recall and precision of a search. Recall is shown by the number of studies retrieved from a validation set, loaded via PubMed IDs. Precision is shown by total number of studies found by each term. Search strategies are compared in terms of the overlap in search terms between two searches, the total number of keywords, the total number of each Boolean operator (i.e., AND, OR, NOT), the number of MeSH keywords (and how many are exploded), and the depth in the MeSH ontology in which the MeSH keywords appear (i.e., how broad MeSH keywords are). Furthermore, each search is evaluated in terms of effectiveness: using standard IR evaluation measures (i.e., precision, recall, F-measure) and evaluation measures specific to this domain (e.g., Work Saved), and in terms of efficiency: by recording the total time spent formulating, the number of studies retrieved, and the estimated cost of the search.\nResults: QueryVis has been tested experimentally in a pilot study. It decreased irrelevant studies by as much as 40% without losing relevant studies. A wider study is planned which aims to involve more participants and capture more data.\nConclusions: Improving the query formulation stage can have a significant impact on the rest of the systematic review creation process. An extensive user study will follow using a well-known corpus of systematic reviews with approximately 10 participants to determine precisely what effect visualisation has on the search strategy formulation process. The study will use the aforementioned methods to compare the effect visualisation has on search by comparing search strategies formulated with and without visualisation.
