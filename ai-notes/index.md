I'm taking a unit this semester on artifical intelligence. I thought I might make some notes for my own reference, any possibly for anyone else that might be interested in my ramblings. Also it's a great distraction from my thesis! These "notes" will be organised in an online book style; it's easier for me to write it like that, and it's nicer to consume for myself and you â€” the beautiful reader ðŸ’ž. 

These notes will be concerned with the theoretical aspects of AI. If you want to start, the first thing to read is [probability theory](probability-theory.html). After I write some more chapters, I'll add a table of contents for convenience.
