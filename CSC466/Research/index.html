<h1>Stage One - Noise Detection</h1>
<p>
   I wanted to start looking at how to use my image processing library and this
   was a good introduction or 'hello world' into image processing with lisp.

   This is the result of the noise detection algorithm. It estimates the amount
   of noise in an image by applying a
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">discrete convolution
   matrix </a>over the image. The matrix looks like this:
   <table>
      <tr>
         <td>
            1
         </td>
         <td>
            -2
         </td>
         <td>
            1
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            -2
         </td>
         <td>
            4
         </td>
         <td>
            -2
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            1
         </td>
         <td>
            -2
         </td>
         <td>
            1
         </td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   An equation is then used to calculate the level of noise in the image. This
   number is calculated using the following formulae:

<h1>Stage Two - Edge Detection</h1>
<p>
   The next step of the process is to detect the brush strokes from an image.
   The process that I used for this includes multiple image manipulation
   processes, but the main act of the show is edge detection.
   <ol>
      <li>
         The image is converted to greyscale, because it make the operations
         faster and easier to manage.
      </li>
      <li>
         The image is blurred to make features stand out more.
      </li>
      <li>
         The image is then dilated to accentuate the brush strokes within.
      </li>
      <li>
         The image then undergoes the edge detection process, this happens via
         another discrete convolution, with a different matrix.
      </li>
      <li>
         A k-means of ```K=2``` is then applied to the image so that edges will
         link together better.
      </li>
      <li>
         The image is then transformed from a greyscale image to a binary 2 bit
         image via a threshold function.
      </li>
      <li>
         The edges are then thinned and any loose pixels are cleaned up.
      </li>
   </ol>

<h1>Stage Three - Feature Extraction</h1>
<p>
   The library that I use to perform the more complicated aspects of this
   project contains a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">
   k-means</a> function, but it dosen't perform how I want it to.
   For this, I modified it so that it would output an image based on what the K
   values was. For feature extraction of the brush strokes, k-means does all of
   the heavy lifting out of getting nice clusters of pixels.
   <img src="starry_night_blob.png" alt="" />
   <br/>
   The edge detection is overlayed on top of a slightly processed reference
   image. While this does not extract all the strokes that I want it to, and
   there are large clusters which impact the outcome of the data, this is good
   for now.

<h1>Stage Four - Starting to paint a picture</h1>
<p>
   I don't have too much to say about this, but here is an origional image side
   by side against the same image with an image filter trained on "The Scream":

   It's only a little disturbing.
