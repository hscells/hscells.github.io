<h2>Input image</h2>
<img src="palm_beach.png" alt="" />
<br/>
This is a photograph I took in 2014. It is at Palm Beach, which is about an hour
north of Sydney.
<hr/>
<h2>Results</h2>

<br/>
<i>Starry Starry Night - Van Gogh</i>
<br/>
The huge range of small strokes make this style of painting very easy for the AI
to replicate. Many of this artists paintings produce a very nice output.
<hr/>

<br/>
<i>Circus Sideshow - Georges Seurat</i>
<br/>
It was hoped that the pointilism style would be replicated in the output,
however, it seems this style of painting is just too much for the AI.
<hr/>

<br/>
<i>Ode to Joy - Craig Graci</i>
<br/>
Because the blocks of colour here are relativly small and close together, the AI
was able to paint a reasonable version of it. A bad example of this is
demonstrated further below.
<hr/>

<img src="palm_beach_pacman.png" alt="" />
<br/>
<i>Pacman - Atari</i>
<br/>
As expected, the outline of the game board has such a significant detail that
the main focus of the resulting image is this.
<hr/>
<img src="the_scream.png" alt="" />
<img src="palm_beach_scream.png" alt="" />
<br/>
<i>The Scream - Edvard Munch</i>
<br/>
A main component of the scream is the bridge, and the AI has picked up on this
feature, and it is very visible in the result.
<hr/>
<img src="mona.png" alt="" />
<img src="palm_beach_mona.png" alt="" />
<br/>
<i>Mona Lisa - Da Vinci</i>
<br/>
Due to how the AI interpreted the backgrounds and how the colours of Mona's
dress are very dark and similar, there are not many features being detected
here. As such, the painting lacks detail and the stokes are large and wild.
<hr/>
<img src="the_gate.png" alt="" />
<img src="palm_beach_the_gate.png" alt="" />
<br/>
<i>The Gate - Hans Hoffman</i>
<br/>
The AI is unable to detect filled in poritions of the painintg, however is does
outline the regions where boxes are.
